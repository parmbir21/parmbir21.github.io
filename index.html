        <p>Hello! I am Parmbir Singh. I don't typically like information about me online, so please excuse the fact that you cannot see my amazing face and in return I'll give a hand-drawn (in Microsoft Paint) masterpiece that I did myself that has been compared to The Greats such as Van Gogh and Da Vinci. Some say that my real face goes beyond the comprehension of mere mortals and can only be described as "a mix bewteen a moldy old cardboard box that is being stretched out due to you shoving your oversized college textbook into so you can return it, and a comicbook civilan that had a horrible accident with nuclear material, but rather than becoming a superhero, I am still just a civilan that now also has a hairing grooming problem due to excessive amounts of hair growth."</p><!--r/oddlyspecific-->

        <p>With formalities out of the way, allow me to tell you a little bit about myself. I am someone that enjoys the very simple and functional lifestyle. Not much goes to making me happy. I enjoy working on personal projects that I have. As for activities with my free time, I enjoy just relaxing and spending time with friends. Whether that might be going on a hike, playing games together (tabletop or videogames), or trying new food! While I do enjoy doing those things myself, like many other activities in life, it is more enjoyable with friends. When I dedicate time for myself, it is more so to work on personal projects such as my spreadsheets, LEGO builds, or theory-crafting deck for Magic: The Gathering ™.</p>

        <br>
          
        <p>I also enjoy watching anime. I do like to keep track of what I am currently watching, what I have watched, and what I plan to watch -- although that list only ever seems to expand rather than shrink (and also doesn't really update as much on my spreadsheet as my other version that is kept on a separate website). This can be viewed within the "Portfolio" section of this webpage. And this is not limited to just anime -- I also find just working with data super interesting as you can draw many interesting conclusions and use those conclusions to make meaningful changes or just learn something new about the information/topic. I have a multitude of spreadsheets just to gather [seemingly] random items in my life that I like to track and just to gain information on. These spreadsheets vary from tracking anime, to expense tracking and categorizing, to time tracking! I just find it endlessly interesting to ask myself a question and be able to find interesting results and use that to make better judgements about those topics. Another spreadsheet that I recently started is one that is centered around my hobby for Magic: The Gatherieng ™. There is a lot that goes into them, and I got curious enough that I decided to invest more time into them. As such, it is still very rough and only has basic information within that I intend to expand on in the future. Recently, I did stop updating my Magic: The Gatherieng ™ card database. It started to run into some preformance issues because apparently Google Sheets doesn't like having 5+ million cells being used. Who would have thought? I will have to create a SQL database for it now. It was only a matter of time, but I do wish it lasted a little longer. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to send me a message!</p>

        <br>
          
        <p>And that's about all I can say about myself. I don't really talk much about myself and thus don't really have a lot to say so sorry for keeping it short and simple. I guess if you want to know more about me, you can always shoot me a message! I will most likely ignore it, but it's worth a try! (I do actually read the messages that people do send me, so don't be shy!)</p>

        <br>
          
        <p>Update! I asked my friends what words they would use to describe me and why. Some described me as robotic due to me being unreasonably objective a lot of the time. Others described my lifestyle as minimalistic due to me not having a lot of possesions. I would refute this idea of me being a minimalist. While I do have a relativistic minimalist lifestyle, that is more of a byproduct of the resulting lifestyle choices I make which I would describe as: "functionalist." As the name suggests, I make choices for my lifestyle that serve a function in my life. It just so happens that I  don't need many things in my life for it to function at a reasonable level.</p>
